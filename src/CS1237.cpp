 * @mainpage ADC (CS1237) Library from Julian Weidinger
 *
 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * As part of my bachelor thesis, I developed a device to measure the hardness differences in the snowpack.
 * This can be attached to a ski touring probe. To take a measurement, the probe is inserted into the snow.
 * The result is a hardness profile of the snowpack over the depth. The hardness measurement was carried out
 * with the help of two load cells, two instrument amplifiers and two AD converters integrated in the microcontroller.
 * Errors occurred because  * the analog cables of the load cells were probably picking up electromagnetic interference.
 * For this reason I selected an AD converter chip (CS1237) with an integrated amplifier and created a circuit board.
 * The translated datasheet can be found [here](https://github.com/rafaellcoellho/cs1237-datasheet/blob/master/cs1237_datasheet.pdf).
 * Every interface and timing information of the CS1237-Chip is taken out of this datasheet and isn't extra cited.
 * The standard ADC-coverter (HX711) has a too slow sample rate, to use in my measurement device and the chips from other
 * manufacturers ware too expensive. I wrote the following Arduino library as part of a study project "data communication"
 * to create the digital interface between the ADC chip and the ESP32-microcontroller. breakoutboard for
 * the ADC-chip was developed by myself, because I couldn't find a breakout to buy. In the following pictures you can see circuit diagram,
 * the front and back schematic and a 3D-model of the breakoutboard:

 *
 * @section describtion Theme of the project
 *
 * The aim of the work is, to write a library, to configure the ADC and get the measured analog signal.
 * The best solution would be an interrupt driven library, where you can connect two ADCs to the MCU and read it parralell in the background.
 * Another nice feature would be to connect multiple ADCs to one clock line and read the ADCs synchronous.
 *
 *
 * @section description_ADC Description of the ADC (CS1237)
 *
 * The gain (1,2,64,128), the sample rate(10Hz,40Hz,640Hz,1280Hz), the reference voltage (internal, or external)
 * and the channel(external diferential signal, temperature sensor) of the ADC can be independent configured.
 * The interface of the ADC chip has a unidirectional clock line “CLK” and a bidirectional data line "DOUT/DIN". The clock-
 * line is used for the clock signal and for switching the chip on and off (sleep mode). The data line is used on the one
 * hand to transmit the AD measurement and on the other hand to configure the chip. In addition, an interrupt signal is
 * outputted via the data line for 26,13 us, if a new measurement is available, depending on the configured measurement
 * frequency. The interrupt of the ADC is also outputed during digital data transmission. It must therefore
 * be ensured, that the data transmission is completed at this point, otherwise the result will be incorrect. In the following
 * image a oscilloscope capture of the finished library and three datatransmission processes with the interrupts of the ADC chip
 * can be seen:
 *

 *
 * @section description_library Description of the setup, the code and the attemps to get it working
 *
 * The library is written in Visual Studio Code in C++. For flashing the ESP32 the Arduino extension from Microsoft was used.
 *
 * My first idea was to connect several chips to one clock line in order to save GPIOs. Unfortunately, after several attempts,
 * this was impossible because the internal clock of the chips are not synchronized and the output interrupt occurrs at different
 * times. This is particularly critical with the desired output frequency of 1280 Hz. That's why I decided to write a C ++ library,
 * in which several instances with different clock lines can be created. The number of ADCs to connect to one MCU is limited to two.
 * The reason is, that the timing is critical especially, when the sample rate is set to 1280. The library could be written to allow
 * more than two instances running in parallel, if the high sample rates are blocked, but that is a future work.
 *
 * This current library is written with hardware and timer interrupt service routines, so it can run in the background, while the main code is running.
 * And the last measured analog value, which is updated in the background, can be called up anytime. In the next picture you can see a screenshot
 * of the Arduino-Serial-Plotter, while the example code runs on the ESP32 with two ADCs. There is some noise in the signal. This is probably
 * due to the long unshielded cables or due to the PCB layout. The signal is periodic so, in a future work it could be filtered
 * with fourier transformation: The setup can be seen in the next picture. For the differential analog signal were two 10kg loadcells used one is
 * screwed in the negativ and the other in the positive direction to show, that the ADC-library woks in both directions:

 * @section dependencies Dependencies
 *
 * This library was only tested on the ESP32 DEV_KIT_V4
 *
 *  - At this time it is only allowed to connect two ADCs with one clock and one data line each.
 *  - you could use nearly any GPIO for the clock lines and any GPIO with an interrupt function for the Data line.
 *  - to the ADC were two 10kg loadcells connected.
